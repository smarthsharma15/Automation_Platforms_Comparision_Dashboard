Automation Platforms Comparison Dashboard

1. Project Overview
This Dashboard is a Power BI dashboard crafted to compare leading automation platforms—Zapier, Power Automate, and Make—based on critical factors like costs, workflows, and features. The purpose of this project is to empower users, whether individuals or businesses, to make informed decisions when choosing an automation tool by presenting a standardized, side-by-side analysis. The dashboard leverages data from an Excel file containing detailed plan pricing, workflow capacities, and feature sets for each platform.

What It Offers:
  Data-Driven Comparison: Aggregates and standardizes data across platforms for an apples-to-apples evaluation.
  Key Metrics: Focuses on costs (ranging from $11 to $1,163), workflows (25,000 to 4,000,000), and feature availability.
  User-Centric Design: Built to help users identify the best platform for their specific automation needs.
  The dashboard standardizes costs to "workflows" as the common unit (e.g., assuming 1 workflow = 5 tasks for Zapier) and prioritizes features into High, Medium, and Low categories, ensuring a balanced and practical comparison.

2. Key Insights and Features
   The dashboard delivers actionable insights and interactive features to simplify the decision-making process. Here’s what stands out:

Cost Comparison Methodology
Standardized Costs: Costs are normalized to "workflows" for consistency:
Power Automate and Make use workflows or equivalent units directly.
Zapier uses "tasks"; we estimate 1 workflow = 5 tasks (a simplification—adjust based on your use case).
Range: Plans span from Make’s "Core" at $11 for 2,000 workflows to premium tiers costing up to $1,163 for 200,000+ workflows.
Feature Prioritization
Features are grouped by importance to highlight what matters most:

High Priority: Core automation capabilities like "Zaps" (Zapier), "Flows" (Power Automate), and "Scenarios" (Make).
Medium Priority: Handy extras like "Delay," "Interfaces," and "Data Storage."
Low Priority: Specialized tools like "Custom Code Execution" or "AI Builder."

Visualizations and Tables
  Bar Chart: "Monthly Cost by Category" shows costs across plan tiers (Free, Team, Premium) from $0 to $3K.
  Cost Table: Breaks down specifics, e.g., Make’s $632 plan for 200,000 workflows.
  Feature Comparison Table: Details availability and limits (e.g., "Analytics" with 100 calls/week).
  Pros and Cons Table: Highlights qualitative aspects, like Make’s "Drag-and-drop interface" (pro) vs. "Complex app connections" (con).

Interactivity
  Sliders: Filter by monthly cost ($0 to $9,684) or workflows (20 to 1,600,000).
  Dropdowns: Narrow down to specific platforms or features.
These elements combine quantitative data and qualitative insights, making it easy to weigh options.

# Automation Platforms Comparison Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard is designed to compare leading automation platforms—**Zapier**, **Power Automate**, and **Make**—by evaluating critical factors such as costs, workflows, and features. Its primary goal is to empower both individuals and businesses to make informed decisions when selecting an automation tool by presenting a standardized, side-by-side analysis. The dashboard leverages data from an Excel file that includes detailed plan pricing, workflow capacities, and feature sets for each platform.

**What It Offers:**
- **Data-Driven Comparison:** Aggregates and standardizes data across platforms for an apples-to-apples evaluation.
- **Key Metrics:** Focuses on costs (ranging from $11 to $1,163), workflows (from 25,000 to 4,000,000), and feature availability.
- **User-Centric Design:** Helps users identify the best platform for their specific automation needs.

> **Note:** The dashboard standardizes costs to "workflows" as the common unit (e.g., assuming 1 workflow = 5 tasks for Zapier) and prioritizes features into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** categories to ensure a balanced and practical comparison.

## 2. Key Insights and Features

### Cost Comparison Methodology
- **Standardized Costs:**  
  - Costs are normalized to "workflows" for consistency.
  - *Power Automate* and *Make* use workflows (or equivalent units) directly.
  - *Zapier* uses "tasks"; we estimate **1 workflow = 5 tasks** (a simplification—adjust based on your specific use case).

- **Cost Range:**  
  - Plans range from Make’s "Core" at **$11 for 2,000 workflows** to premium tiers costing up to **$1,163 for 200,000+ workflows**.

### Feature Prioritization
- **High Priority:**  
  - Core automation capabilities, such as **"Zaps" (Zapier)**, **"Flows" (Power Automate)**, and **"Scenarios" (Make)**.
  
- **Medium Priority:**  
  - Handy extras like **"Delay," "Interfaces,"** and **"Data Storage."**
  
- **Low Priority:**  
  - Specialized or advanced tools, such as **"Custom Code Execution"** or **"AI Builder."**

### Visualizations and Tables
- **Bar Chart:**  
  - "Monthly Cost by Category" displays costs across plan tiers (Free, Team, Premium) ranging from **$0 to $3K**.
  
- **Cost Table:**  
  - Breaks down specifics (e.g., Make’s **$632 plan for 200,000 workflows**).
  
- **Feature Comparison Table:**  
  - Details feature availability and limits (e.g., "Analytics" with **100 calls/week**).
  
- **Pros and Cons Table:**  
  - Highlights qualitative aspects, such as Make’s **"Drag-and-drop interface" (pro)** versus **"Complex app connections" (con)**.

### Interactivity
- **Sliders:**  
  - Filter by monthly cost (**$0 to $9,684**) or workflows (**20 to 1,600,000**).
  
- **Dropdowns:**  
  - Narrow down comparisons to specific platforms or features.

These elements combine quantitative data with qualitative insights, making it easier for users to weigh their options and select the most suitable automation platform.

## And Much More
- **Comprehensive Analysis:**  
  - Offers a complete look at costs, features, and usability across multiple platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  - Interactive elements and intuitive design enhance the overall experience.
- **Actionable Recommendations:**  
  - Provides insights that help users identify the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, ensuring informed decision-making.
